# Certainly

> Certainly is a method architecture and certification advisory. We help founders and institutions extract, document, and scale their proprietary methods through certification programs, licensing frameworks, and governance systems — without dilution.

## About

Certainly works with founder-led consulting firms, standards organizations, advisory practices with proprietary frameworks, and institutional leaders stewarding intellectual capital. We do not work with early-stage creators. Clients must already have proof of results.

Our work is structured around four phases: Diagnose, Preserve, Build, and Steward. We design the trust mechanism — certification, licensing, or internal credentialing — that fits the method and the market.

## Key Concepts

- **Method Architecture**: The discipline of structuring proprietary expertise so it can be delivered, assessed, and governed by others.
- **Systems of Trust™**: The framework Certainly uses to evaluate whether an organization's credibility is structural or personality-dependent.
- **Trust Architecture™ Review**: A diagnostic engagement that assesses trust across five dimensions: Authority, Scalability, Market Legibility, Structural Discipline, and Vulnerability Awareness.
- **Certification Pilot**: A 120-day structured launch of a certification program, including assessment, governance, and market entry.
